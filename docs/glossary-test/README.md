Been out all
[night](mainGlossary.md#night
"&#9998; Night
&nbsp;
Comes after day."),

I needed a bite,

I thought I'd put a [record](mainGlossary.md#record "&#9998; Record
&nbsp;
Really old way of playing recorded music."
)
on

I reached for the one with the
[ultra-modern](mainGlossary.md#ultra-modern "&#9998; Ultra-modern
&nbsp;
Very, very modern indeed."
) label,

And wondered where the [light](mainGlossary.md#light "&#9998; Light
&nbsp;
Lightens things up."
) had gone

It had a [futuristic](mainGlossary.md#futuristic "&#9998; Futuristic
&nbsp;
Looks as if it comes from the future."
) cover, lifted straight from
[Buck Rogers](mainGlossary.md#buck-rogers "&#9998; Buck Rogers
&nbsp;
Guy from the 25th century.")

The record was so black it had to be a
[con](mainGlossary.md#con "&#9998; Con
&nbsp;
Alternative term for hoax or swindle.")

The [autochanger](mainGlossary.md#autochanger "&#9998; Autochanger
&nbsp;
Thing that changes records automatically.")
switched as I filled my [sandwich](mainGlossary.md#sandwich "&#9998; Sandwich
&nbsp;
Convenience food made from bread.")

And futuristic sounds warbled off and on
